# DiscordBot - Music Bot for my own Discord server
<br>

>It is not easy nowadays to find a flawless discord bot that can play music from YouTube, so I decided to make one to our discord server and run in the cloud.
<br>

 <b>The main purpose for this really tiny application is to play music from YouTube to my friends</b>


- I used some npm packages such as *discord-player-music*
- Not 100% perfect I have to find out some problems with queue
- Hosted on Heroku so up time is 24/7
- It's just a really tiny Node.js hobby project to really help my friends
